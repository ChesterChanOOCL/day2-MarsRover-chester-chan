ORID (Day 2) 


Objective: 
 Today I learned more about on TDD (Test-driven development). Not only test we should focus on before coding, actually the Tasking mentioned yesterday matters. 
 Also, the java project - Mars rover reminds me the usage of enum and the way to build test case for each scenario.

Reflective: 
 I feel great learning this methodologies and I completed the task more efficiently. 

Interpretive:
Learning about TDD and tasking has provided me with a clearer understanding of how to structure my development process. 
The emphasis on writing tests before coding ensures that I think through the requirements and edge cases upfront, which leads to more robust and reliable code. 
The Mars Rover project, in particular, talked abput the practical application of enums and the importance of comprehensive test cases.
This approach  improves my code quality and also boosts up my clearance and understanding in the solutions I develop.

Decision: 
For now on, I will integrate TDD with yesterday Context-Mapping into my regular workflow.
I plan to start writing mini tasks for test case and make mini commit as good practice, in order to maintain focus and track progress.
